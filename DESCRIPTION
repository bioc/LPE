Description: This LPE library is used to do significance analysis of
        microarray data with small number of replicates. It uses
        resampling based FDR adjustment, and gives less conservative
        results than traditional 'BH' or 'BY' procedures. Data accepted
        is raw data in txt format from MAS4, MAS5 or dChip. Data can
        also be supplied after normalization. LPE library is primarily
        used for analyzing data between two conditions. To use it for
        paired data, see LPEP library. For using LPE in multiple
        conditions, use HEM library.
